# Drug Dealer Guide - Strategies
As a drug dealer you risk a lot carrying drugs on you as they can be confiscated by cops. These are a few strategies that I have come up with to avoid losing my drugs.

**Don't be Greedy!**

If you own a [Warehouse](../assets/warehouses.md), put all your drugs in there and only take out around 200 grams at a time. If cops catch you, the losses will be a lot smaller than if you carried your whole stash on you.

**Overdose**

If cops are about to seize your drugs, have a bit of meth/heroin in your INVENTORY [not job inventory] and use one of the following commands:

`/use meth 5` or `/use heroin 5`

This will overdose you and make you die, making the cops unable to seize your drugs, unless they have naxolone.

Should probably also mention naxalone in the items section

**Arsonist**

If you get yourself very low on health, you can quickly kill yourself to avoid losing your drugs. As cops rarely travel with medics, if you get a wanted level and cops are about to catch you, light yourself on fire to avoid arrest. To do this effectively, prepare a puddle of gasoline under you before starting to sell drugs and quickly shoot it when cops are on your tail.


**Teamwork!**

If you sell with a few dealers at the same time on one spot, it will be a lot easier to defend against cops in a joint effort!


**Flee**

If you barricade the entrance to your spot, it gives you a few extra seconds of advantage to prepare for fleeing or fighting the cops! Have a getaway vehicle ready if you want to flee and make it face the direction of the getaway, here is a simple plan for an escape from Drug Spot 11.
