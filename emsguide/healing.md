# EMS Guide - Healing
Healing wounded players requires the use of a Paramedic vehicle marked with various hospital symbols and usually in red or white colors.
Ask them over voice or text chat to get next to your ambulance.
You can then heal them using 'X' or d-pad up, charging a small fee for your services.
